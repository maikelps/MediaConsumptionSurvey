# Media Consumption Survey

This project uses the source data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuanmozhu/deloitte-media-consumption-survey which is a dataset that shows more than 2000 records of users' media consumption behaviors and users' demographic information in the United States.

* **checking_data.ipynb** is a notebook containing a pipeline to clean the data, group it by user and question type. This is a format that is easy for an exploration by means of filtering.

* **getting_insights.ipynb** is a notebook that creates the visuals used on the article I've written on my substack: https://amathematicianthinks.substack.com/ as well as extra visualizations. All these visuals are stored on the "PLOTS" folder.
